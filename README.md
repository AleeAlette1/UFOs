# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to build a webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordng to display information about UFO sightings. Users would be able to filter UFO sightings based on multiple criteria such as Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

## Results
A user can perform a search by doing the following: 

1. Navigate to the webpage https://github.com/AleeAlette1/UFOs . The inital page will look like the following image. User can re-initialize the page by clickin on the 'UFO Sightings' navbar on the top left of page.

2. Enter any criteria into the filter search boxes on the left side of the screen (Displayed below). User can filter data by usiing one, multiple or all critera filter search boxes. If filtering by date, date format should read x/xx/xxxx. To filter by city, state, counttry or shape, use lowercase letters only.

## Summary
- One drawback to this webage is that the design does not allow you to list the results in a certain way. For example, if a user filtered the table by a city to see all the sightings in that city, the user cannot have the results listed with all the triangle shapes first and circles second.

- My frist recommendation would be adding a drop-down list to each filter value in order to be able to list the results as desired. 

- My second recommendattion would be to add a clear button below the filter search boxes so that users don't need to erase all filters manually or have to scroll back up to the top of the page.
